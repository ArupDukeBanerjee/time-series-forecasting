# Wind Power Forecasting

+ It is a kaggle problem
+ The aim was to predict the wind power that could be generated from the windmill for the next 15 days. A long term wind forecasting technique is thus required.
+ It contains various weather, turbine and rotor features. Data has been recorded from January 2018 till March 2020. Readings have been recorded at a 10-minute interval.

## _Process summary:
Downloading data -> Feature selection -> period of forecasting selection -> standardize values -> Splitting data into train, test and validation -> Build stacked GRU model -> Actual Vs prediction plot
